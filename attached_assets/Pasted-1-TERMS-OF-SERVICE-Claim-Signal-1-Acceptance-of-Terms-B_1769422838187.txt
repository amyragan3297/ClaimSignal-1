4. ALABAMA-SPECIFIC LEGAL ALIGNMENT NOTES

(Internal reference or attorney handoff)
	•	Alabama recognizes at-will employment but enforces written contracts.
	•	Claim Signal avoids regulated public adjuster activity by:
	•	Not negotiating claims
	•	Not representing insureds
	•	Not directing claim communications
	•	Platform language avoids “advice,” “recommendation,” or “representation” claims
	•	Intelligence framed as behavioral trend analysis, not outcome prediction
	•	No consumer-facing policy interpretation

This positioning materially reduces regulatory exposure under Alabama law.
Below is a single, comprehensive in-app legal protection module you can deploy immediately.
It is written to be maximally defensive, internally consistent, and practical.
This is not marketing copy. This is protection language.

You can place this as:
	•	A required acceptance screen on first login
	•	A persistent footer link labeled “Legal”
	•	A modal that must be acknowledged to continue
