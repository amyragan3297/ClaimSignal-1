Dear State Farm Claims Department,

I am following up on the formal dispute and reinspection request submitted on [insert date sent] regarding Claim #01-91G7-91L (Policy #01-EC-A684-1) for Vada Andre Samuels, property located at 13153 Covington Dr, Athens, AL 35613.

As outlined in the attached letter, the initial Seek Now inspection did not meet standard procedure, and verified storm data confirms hail and wind activity on May 20, 2025. We requested full documentation — including the Summary of Loss, Seek Now inspection report, and adjuster notes — along with a reinspection by a licensed field adjuster.

Please confirm receipt of our original submission and provide an update on the reassignment or scheduling of the reinspection. If this request has already been forwarded to a field adjuster, kindly provide the contact name and inspection date.

Thank you for your prompt attention and cooperation.

Respectfully,
Amy Ragan
