Stage Two Components (what we build)

1. Adjuster Intelligence Panel

This appears on the Adjuster Profile, below what you already built.

Displays only derived data, such as:
	•	Total interactions
	•	Number of claims involved
	•	Average time to resolution
	•	Escalations used (count)
	•	Outcomes distribution (resolved vs stalled)

No scores yet. Just facts.

⸻

2. Pattern Tags (system-generated)

The system generates internal tags like:
	•	“Reinspection-heavy”
	•	“Escalation-responsive”
	•	“Slow initial response”
	•	“Documentation-sensitive”

Important:
	•	You do NOT manually tag these
	•	They come from interaction + claim history
	•	They are private

This answers:

“What’s the playbook with this person”

⸻

3. Carrier Intelligence Snapshot

At the carrier level, aggregated across adjusters you’ve dealt with:
	•	Common denial points
	•	Avg resolution time
	•	Escalation effectiveness
	•	Typical interaction count per claim

This is where your carrier playbooks quietly form.

⸻

Stage Two Rules (non-negotiable)
	•	No sharing
	•	No public data
	•	No user submissions
	•	No AI recommendations yet
	•	No ownership ambiguity

This stage is still yours, legally and practically.

⸻

When Stage Two is DONE

Stage Two is complete when:
	•	You can open an adjuster
	•	Scroll once
	•	Immediately understand what you’re walking into

No more guessing.

⸻

STAGE THREE — DECISION SUPPORT (Carefully Controlled)

Stage Three is where the app starts helping you decide, but never acts for you.

This is where most tools fail. We won’t.

⸻

Stage Three Goal

Answer this question:

“What should I do first, based on what usually works”

Not automation. Guidance.

Stage Three Components

1. Tactical Advisor (Unlocked Carefully)

This is the thing you intentionally muted earlier. Now it earns its place.

It displays suggestions, not actions:
	•	“Escalation historically works earlier with this adjuster”
	•	“Documentation-heavy submissions resolve faster here”
	•	“Expect reinspection after first denial”

No buttons. No workflows. No auto-anything.
